00:00:08.983 --> 00:00:12.109
Good day everyone. My name is
Tamar. Today I'm going to

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/20-1
00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:13.393
present to you, but my.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/41-0
00:00:14.183 --> 00:00:19.545
W Simon. So for this topic, the
teller said I choose is dry by

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/41-1
00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:24.226
company and the main problem
statement that need to be

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/41-2
00:00:24.226 --> 00:00:25.673
studied for this.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/57-0
00:00:26.973 --> 00:00:30.584
Some probably is understanding
revenue and profit or GI by

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/57-1
00:00:30.584 --> 00:00:31.073
company.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/64-0
00:00:32.173 --> 00:00:33.713
So for Wei, it means the.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/74-0
00:00:34.663 --> 00:00:37.913
To do this, create analytics of
the data set using.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/78-0
00:00:39.063 --> 00:00:39.693
The software.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/80-0
00:00:40.913 --> 00:00:41.263
Correct.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/88-0
00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:43.523
So the business domain problems
thing.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/92-0
00:00:46.203 --> 00:00:47.393
OK, now so I'm gonna.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/100-0
00:00:49.343 --> 00:00:51.483
Demonstrate you how it looks
like.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/108-0
00:00:52.513 --> 00:00:54.533
Would you buy a company that
organization?

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/119-0
00:00:55.693 --> 00:01:00.096
So the first one here is the
profit margin USD against the

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/119-1
00:01:00.096 --> 00:01:00.543
state.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/140-0
00:01:01.403 --> 00:01:05.243
So the bar chart here indicates
that California has the highest

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/140-1
00:01:05.243 --> 00:01:08.723
profit margin in United State
dollars for the GUI come by

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/140-2
00:01:08.723 --> 00:01:09.383
company as.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/161-0
00:01:10.143 --> 00:01:13.783
As you all know that I sell
bikes as the mean business

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/161-1
00:01:13.783 --> 00:01:17.688
domain and then here is the
country fairs here and you can

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/161-2
00:01:17.688 --> 00:01:18.283
see here.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/181-0
00:01:19.193 --> 00:01:22.342
Is a conversation between two
countries, Germany and other

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/181-1
00:01:22.342 --> 00:01:25.490
states, and it shows that for
both country the revenue for

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/181-2
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.863
Europe.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/190-0
00:01:26.673 --> 00:01:28.903
The highest is in 2012 but.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/197-0
00:01:29.803 --> 00:01:32.453
Not the state is much more
higher than Germany.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/213-0
00:01:33.153 --> 00:01:36.988
In terms of selling the bike and
you can see the state we as the

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/213-1
00:01:36.988 --> 00:01:37.873
profit revenue.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/239-0
00:01:40.513 --> 00:01:44.187
Here is the graph between the
profit margin in your against

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/239-1
00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:47.861
the state, and you can divide
this into two cluster cluster

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/239-2
00:01:47.861 --> 00:01:49.943
one, cluster two and cluster
one.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/250-0
00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:54.921
But it's different colors and
you can show us that for cluster

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/250-1
00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:55.053
2.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/259-0
00:01:56.743 --> 00:01:59.933
California has the highest
profit margin in Europe.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/284-0
00:02:01.043 --> 00:02:05.590
And the lowest is in the DC in
Washington. Here you can see the

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/284-1
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.852
the graph of revenue in your

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/284-2
00:02:09.852 --> 00:02:10.633
issue that.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/290-0
00:02:11.483 --> 00:02:12.883
So for this kind of.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/298-0
00:02:15.413 --> 00:02:17.723
Daughter, you can talk a trend
line.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/302-0
00:02:19.103 --> 00:02:20.433
And you can predict the.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/307-0

We can estimate here in this
crash agree region. Here you can

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/321-1
00:02:28.507 --> 00:02:29.003
see the.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/332-0

This point here, because the
revenue, the predictive value.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/356-0
00:02:39.603 --> 00:02:42.788

00:02:51.393 --> 00:02:53.413
But detector evening, which at
this value.

Here in this uh, right.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/388-0
00:02:58.893 --> 00:03:01.063
Pop up window. Here you can see
the.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/392-0
00:03:02.753 --> 00:03:05.283
Devitalization so for city.

now moved on to dashboard too?

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/416-0
00:03:15.353 --> 00:03:16.523
So this one is the.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/418-0
00:03:17.713 --> 00:03:18.183
The.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/420-0
00:03:19.303 --> 00:03:19.723

00:03:20.883 --> 00:03:23.612
Against the the measure
variables. So for the magic

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/433-1
00:03:23.612 --> 00:03:25.133
variables in the wireless is.

The first one is cause of good
soul and that's the quantity in

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/469-1
00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.078
here is the heat map. So for the
month of code that is going to

The normal one to dashboard
tree.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/704-0
00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:21.683
Here is just the the table that
shows the granted to of each.

9739d8b5-99c9-4040-9260-86aa98b850d5/710-0
